This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating a common pointer-related bug. The program intends to modify the value of an integer variable through a pointer.  However, the implementation might lead to undefined behavior or unexpected results if not handled properly. The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle this scenario.  The bug.c file presents the buggy code and bugSolution.c shows the corrected version.
